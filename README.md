# Planck Keyboard keymap (updated 9/12/2016)

This is the keymap of my current Planck Keyboard layout and the hex file for flashing firmware (programmed using easy AVR).

The planck keyboard I'm currently using is from R2 group buy of Massdrop, has rev4 pcb, MIT plate, orange anodized aluminum bottom, Zealios 78g switches, blue and orange LEDs and DSA Dolch Keycaps. 

For the default layer, I switched the positions between esc and tab, backlight and ctrl and alt and windows to fit the default qwerty layout.

For the lower layer, I used a numpad layout on the 4X4 keys of the board's right side to fit the number buttons and kept the shift on the left for symbol options. I've also put a second set of arrow keys on wasd, and set the home, pageup and pagedown buttons to the three keys below wasd. (I still need to find a way to put the bracket keys on upper layer (Fixed*))


For the upper layer, I placed F1 to F12 at the center, 6 media keys on the left and mouse control keys on the right.

*UPDATE 9/12/2016: I removed the mouse control keys in the upper layer and replaced 2 of them with opening and closing brackets and kept the enter and semicolon keys for programming purposes.
